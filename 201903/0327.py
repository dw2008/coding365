#For a given number, if it can be divided by 3 print "this number {} can be divided by 3 ",
#if it can be divided by 2 print "this number {} can be divided by 2"
#if it can be divided by 2 and 3, print "this number {} can be divided by 2 and 3"
#for rest scenario, just print "number {} "
#Challenge: can you pass in the number from command line instead hard-code it in code? See: https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/argv/more-fun-with-sys-argv
