#Given an ordered list which is sorted in descending order and a target. 
#Return the position in the list if target exist in the list
#If target does not exist in the list, return the position this target should be inserted to. 
#Example: [4, 2, 1] target = 3, return 1(the third position in the list) since 3 should be inserted before 2 and after 4.
